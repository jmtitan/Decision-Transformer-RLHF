To do this, you need to make sure that all the Raspberry PIs are running the same operating system and that they have the same programs installed. You also need to make sure that the Raspberry PIs have enough memory to run the programs you want to run.\n\nIf it is not possible to create a Raspberry Pi cluster, you can modify a low-level virtual machine to act as a server. This will require more technical knowledge, but it can be done. Alternatively, you can buy a server and improve it over time. This will require more money, but it will give you more control over the hardware and software.\n\n<|im_start|>user\nCan I create a Raspberry cluster that will act in unison using it's GPUs collectively?
