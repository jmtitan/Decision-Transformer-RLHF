To achieve this, you would need to load the program that you want to run on each Raspberry Pi into RAM.

This would allow you to run different operating systems or software on each Raspberry Pi, but it may not be as efficient as using the Raspberry PIs' CPUs collectively.\n\nAs for buying a server and improving it over time, this is certainly an option.

However, it can be quite challenging to achieve this, and it may be more sensible to consider other options such as using a server or modifying a low-level virtual machine.\n\nOne option would be to use a low-level virtual machine such as Linux. This would allow you to run multiple instances of a single operating system on a single Raspberry Pi. You could then use these instances to run different programs or applications simultaneously. This approach has the advantage of allowing you to take advantage of the full capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, including its powerful CPU and RAM.\n\nAnother option would be to use a server or other type of hardware to run your programs.
