He claims that without the unity of self-consciousness, all of our perceptions would be unrelated and disconnected, and we would have no way to connect them into a meaningful experience.\n\nIn other words, Kant believes that the unity of self-consciousness provides the necessary framework for organizing and synthesizing the various contents of our experience. This unity is a priori because it is a necessary condition for the possibility of any experience at all.\n\nBy positing the transcendental unity of self-consciousness, Kant argues that we can have a priori knowledge of the necessary conditions for the possibility of experience. This knowledge is not based on empirical observation or sensory experience but is instead derived from the structure of our own consciousness.","source":"generated"}

The walls, buildings, and other structures clutter the immense black metropolis and glow at the edges like heated glass.

The architecture is hooked to the corner as the monolithic deep reds, blacks, and grays, nothing belies an exterior that would seem to be welcoming to a traveling pack of people. At the center, visible everywhere in the city, is the Iron Tower, an impossibly colossal and unreachable tower of black iron and lead that stretches for hundreds of miles into the sky before vanishing into the dark, clouded expanse. The Iron Tower is the throne of the archdevil Dispater and stands ever-vigilant over his Iron City of Dis.\nThe city of Dis is always changing and being rebuilt in accordance with the decree of paranoid Dispater.\"","source":"generated"}

However, human pose estimation from images is adversely affected by occlusion and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of interest. Radar and LiDAR technologies, on the other hand, need specialized hardware that is expensive and power-intensive. Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection. This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence. We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and amplitude of WiFi signals to UV coordinates within 24 human regions. The results of the study reveal that our model can estimate the dense pose of multiple subjects, with comparable performance to image-based approaches, by utilizing WiFi signals as the only input. This paves the way for low-cost, broadly accessible, and privacy-preserving algorithms for human sensing.\n\nGiven this paper on mapping Channel state information from wifi routers to a dense pose, the main limitation is the diversity of wifi hardware and lack of data. Could a wide adoption of Starlink lead to a global dense pose map peering into homes, airplanes, and underground bunker's w\/wifi?","source":"generated"}
